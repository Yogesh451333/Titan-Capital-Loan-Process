            <li>Enter your username and password to access the broker dashboard.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 2: Starting a New Loan Application</h2>
        <h3>Initiate a New Application</h3>
        <p>With your account set up, you can now begin a new loan application directly from the dashboard.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Click on “New Application” to start the process.</li>
            <li>Choose the type of loan application you want to submit (e.g., Term Loan, Business Line of Credit).</li>
            <li>Select “Term Loan” to proceed.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Agree to Terms and Conditions</h3>
        <p>Before moving forward, you’ll need to review and agree to Titan Capital’s terms and conditions.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Read the terms and conditions presented on the screen.</li>
            <li>Click “Agree” to confirm and continue.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Enter Property Information</h3>
        <p>Next, you’ll need to provide details about the property being used as security for the loan.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter the property’s address into the search field provided.</li>
            <li>The system will automatically search for the property details in our database.</li>
            <li>If the address is not found, you can manually enter the property details.</li>
            <li>If the property does not meet our criteria, the loan may be rejected at this stage.</li>
            <li>You’ll have options to adjust the Loan-to-Value Ratio (LVR) or add another property as additional security.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 3: Moving Forward with Your Application</h2>
        <h3>Review Property Details and Security Type</h3>
        <p>Once the property is accepted, you’ll review and confirm the property details and select the type of security.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the details auto-filled by the system.</li>
            <li>Select the appropriate security type from the dropdown menu.</li>
            <li>If you need to choose “Other” for security type, the application will be sent to the Credit Team for review.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Provide Borrower Information</h3>
        <p>You’ll now enter specific details about the borrower, including financial information.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enter borrower information such as income sources and existing debts.</li>
            <li>If the property is owned by multiple parties, add the additional owners and their details.</li>
            <li>Fill in any remaining details about the property, such as lease expiry and mortgage rank.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Step 4: Completing the Loan Application</h2>
        <h3>Upload Required Documents</h3>
        <p>With the main details completed, you’ll need to upload the necessary documents to support the application.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upload documents such as the contract of sale, proof of existence, discharge forms, and IDs.</li>
            <li>All documents should be uploaded directly through the software for security and privacy reasons.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Final Review and Submission</h3>
        <p>Before submitting, you’ll have the opportunity to review all the information you’ve entered.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Carefully review the entire application to ensure accuracy.</li>
            <li>Click “Submit” to finalize and send your application to Titan Capital.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Immediate Response</h3>
        <p>Once submitted, the system will provide an immediate response:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Letter of Offer (LOO) Issued:</strong> If approved, you’ll receive an LOO.</li>
            <li><strong>Rejected:</strong> If the loan is not approved, you’ll be notified immediately.</li>
            <li><strong>Pending Credit Review:</strong> If further review is needed, your application will be sent to the Credit Team.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Final Steps</h2>
        <p>If everything is in order and the loan is approved, the final loan amount will be calculated, and all relevant parties will be informed.
